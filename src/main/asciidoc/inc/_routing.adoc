URLs should be consistent, short, canonical and easy to remember, while also being extensible. It can be common to have multiple views or operations
for a single entity or a collection of entities.

As an example, here are some examples for routes relating to the entity 'Connection':

* `/connections` view all connections and search using query parameters
* `/connections/:id` view connection given an id
* `/connections/:id/edit` edit connection given an id
* `/connections/new` create new connection
* `/connections/install` custom views for collections of connections such as installing new connections
